      <para id="id22935512">1. Why should we be able to read a map?</para>
      <para id="id22365624">A map is a reduction of reality as it seen perpendicularly from above and drawn to a certain scale. The scale indicates the number of times by which reality is reduced.</para>
      <para id="id11919978">A good map provides information with regard to location, direction, distance, relief, routes and more. The reader can therefore read the information with ease and draw precise conclusions from it.</para>
      <para id="id23368186">The <emphasis effect="bold">series of</emphasis><emphasis effect="bold">1:50 000 topographic maps of South Africa </emphasis>will be used for our studies. This is a collection of maps that cover the whole of South Africa. Each map in the series has a number to indicate its exact location and what its coordinates are. (see section 2.2.3)</para>
      <para id="id11792788">A topographic map does not present phenomena of the landscape only, but also pictures the topography (relief) of the landscape by means of contour lines (see section 2.5.3).</para>
      <para id="id8560052">These maps are all drawn to a scale of 1:50 000. This means that each centimetre on the map in reality represents 50 000 centimetres of the landscape. The true size is therefore reduced 50 times (see section 2.4).</para>
      <para id="id22582485">To be able to read the map, you have to know and understand the symbols that are used in mapping (see section 2.5).</para>

      <para id="id14483216">2.1 Direction and Bearing</para>
      <para id="id14483604">To be useful, a map needs to indicate the direction in which North is located. If such an indication is missing, the map must be rotated to make it readable, i.e. to have words running from left to right. This will position the northern part of the map in the position that is furthest from the reader.</para>
