        <para id="id1168327650638">In South Africa we find a unique land use pattern, because of the political decisions of the past. If we look at an urban map of Port Elizabeth, we notice that certain neighbourhoods are inhabited by more than one population group. This is still the result of the policy of segregation and apartheid legislation before 1994. This policy determined that different population groups were to live in separate areas.</para>

        <para id="id5075299">There was a time when Port Elizabethâ€™s South-End was inhabited by various population groups. However, when the National Party was in power, all residents were relocated to areas such as Malabar en New Brighton. Members of the Indian community were forced to settle in Malabar, and coloured people in New Brighton. This meant that certain people had to leave their homes and start anew. They had no choice as to where they preferred to live. Those belonging to a specific population group were obliged to move to an area allocated to people of their own culture.</para>
        <para id="id7325191">Today we still suffer from the effects of this policy. Sometimes people were concentrated in a neighbourhood without a proper infrastructure like roads, electricity and housing. They could not afford to live anywhere else. </para>

        <para id="id1168320340074">After 1994 steps were taken to compensate some of the people who had been forced to abandon their homes. This changed the shape of current urban patterns. A special commission was formed to handle land claims. The purpose is to rectify the possession of land of those who had been previously disadvantaged by political decisions. Where the original site is no longer available, the family is entitled to financial compensation. Everybody is now entitled to choose where they wish to live. No politician can decide who is to buy or own property, and where.</para>
